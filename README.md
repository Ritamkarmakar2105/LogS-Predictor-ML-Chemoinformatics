# LogS-Predictor-ML-Chemoinformatics
This repository contains a Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) model for predicting the logarithmic solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using molecular descriptors. The project leverages scikit-learn's Linear Regression to build a predictive model trained on the Delaney solubility dataset.
